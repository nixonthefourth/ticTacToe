import module os

define a variable keys that will have linked values for the frames

define variable for playing the game and set it to True
define variable for completeing game that is False

define variable for turn counting equal to zero

define the variable for previous turn it is equal to -1

defines function frameCreation with parameter keys
  using f-strin creates board
  outputting the board
 
defines function turnChecker with parameter turn
  if the modulo of turn is equal to zero
    we are playing as the 'O'
   else
    I am playing as the 'X'
 
defines fnction that will check winner with parametr dict (it's needed for os module)
  if slots 1 = 2 = 3 or 4 = 5 = 6 or 7 = 8 = 9
    return value True
  
  else if slots 1 = 4 = 7 or 2 = 5 = 8 or 3 = 6 = 9
    return value True
  
  else if slots 1 = 5 = 9 or 3 = 5 = 7
    return value True
    else
      return value False
      
input first player's name
input second player's name

while variable game has True statement
  reset the screen with os module
  
  create frame linked to the dictionary
  
  if previous turn is equal to variable turn
    output
    
  previous turn takes teh value of current turn
  output('Player ', (turn modulo 2 plus 1), '`s turn')
  
  input player's choice
  
  if player's choice is equal to 'Q'
    kill program
  else if isdigit and choice
    if there are no X or O
      turn increments to 1
      slots with parammetr choice equals the value of turn checker
      
  if the game has finished the proccess is finished
  if there are more turns than 8 game will end
  
  frame check with os module
  outputs frameboard
  
  if games has finished
    choose the winner
    else
    tie the game
    
output
